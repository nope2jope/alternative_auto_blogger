# alternative_auto_blogger

bootstrapping makes the autoblog more palatable 

expanding on the flask autoblogger, this update makes use of bootstrap to make an overall more aesthetically sound vibe. 
program makes use of flask/jinja, request module to pull api blog posts, and bootstrap 4 with python functionality to automate the process

lacking some personality, as it stands
